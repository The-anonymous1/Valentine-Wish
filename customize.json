This Valentine's Day, though miles stretch wide, my heart travels the distance in a heartbeat, finding its home in yours. With every sunrise, I'm reminded of your light in my life, and with every sunset, I dream of the day our horizons merge. You are my distant star, my love unbounded. Happy Valentine's Day, my heart's dearest voyage.",
